# STRF
The board incorporates an STM32 microcontroller, an RF transceiver, an antenna interface, and a USB full-speed interface. It is designed for various projects, such as logging data from a robot with RF capabilities. The STM32 serves as a link between the RF transceiver and a host computer via USB, and the design emphasizes compactness, measuring 15mm in height and 40mm in length.
